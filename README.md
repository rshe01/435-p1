# Software Engineering 435 - Project 1

This program is written in python and works by accepting one prefix input (ie com.yelp.android) to produce the required annotated output. As such, there are several libraries we must import and potentially install: cv2, re, sys, os. 

Run the following command before executing the program if necessary:
1. pip install opencv-python

The program can be executed through the command line in the following format: *python Solution.py [file prefix]*. For example, *python Solution.py com.yelp.android* will produce an input of com.yelp.android.xml to be parsed and an outputed annotated verison of com.yelp.android.png.
